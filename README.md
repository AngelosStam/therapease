# TherapEase

This repository contains the **TherapEase** psychotherapy platform, with a **Node.js/Express + MongoDB** backend and an **Angular** frontend. 
Below is a detailed overview of what TherapEase offers—first from the therapist’s perspective, then from the client’s—and a step-by-step of how the system works for each user type.

**For the Therapist**

One-Time Setup & Secure Login
    The therapist registers using their special email (angelos_stamatis@outlook.com) and chooses a password at first login.
    Their account is automatically approved and given the therapist role (no waiting).
    Subsequent logins use JWT-backed auth, keeping sessions secure.

Centralized Dashboard (“Appointments” Tab)

    Appointment Requests

        See every pending request from guests or registered clients in a sortable table.

        Columns include:

            Client/Guest – distinguishes existing clients vs one-time guests.
            Full Name & Phone Number.
            Email.
            Requested On – timestamp of when the request arrived.
            Proposed Date & Time (you can edit in-line).
            Message – expandable card for longer notes.
            Actions – “Modify,” “Approve,” or “Cancel.”

        Approving automatically moves the entry into upcoming sessions and sends the client notification.

    Upcoming Sessions

        A calendar view showing approved sessions:

            Days with dots indicate appointments.
            Clicking a date reveals a details card with that day’s sessions.
            From there you can modify or cancel any session in-line.

        Month-by-month navigation, responsive mobile-friendly grid.

Client Management (“MyAccount” Tab → Clients & Access Management)

    Clients

        Lists all approved clients with registration date.
        “Session History” button per client opens a card showing every past session (date & time).

    Access Management

        Shows pending registration requests from new clients.
        Approve or reject with one click; approved clients immediately gain full access.

Library & Materials Upload

    (If desired) Upload worksheets, handouts, and psychoeducational materials in the Library tab (therapist-only).
    Materials display as cards for clients to browse or download.

“My Account” & Branding

    Your name appears top right once logged in.
    Uniform, calming UI with therapy-inspired color palette and fade-in cards.

**For the Client**

*A. Guest (First Appointment)*

    Book an Appointment
        Accessible without registration under “Book an Appointment.”
        Info Card: Highlights a free 30-minute initial consultation, encouraging guests to try the service risk-free.
        Fill in Full Name, E-mail, Phone Number, Preferred Date & Time, and an optional message.
        On submission, you see “Appointment request submitted successfully,” and the therapist is notified.

    Approval Workflow

        The therapist reviews your request, proposes/approves a final date & time, and you receive email confirmation.

*B. Registered Client (Ongoing Care)*

    Registration

        After your first session, you can register: First Name, Last Name, E-mail, Phone Number, Password.
        Therapist approves you; then you log in.

    Logged-In Experience

        Book an Appointment: now only asks for date & time + message (your name, email & phone are pre-filled from your profile).
        My Account → Session History: see a chronological list of all past and upcoming sessions.
        My Account → Bookings: view or cancel upcoming sessions.

    Streamlined Recurrent Booking

        When scheduling, you can opt-in to “Recurrent Sessions” (e.g. weekly), automatically creating repeated appointments.

**How It Works (Workflows)**

*Therapist Workflow*

    Log in → land on Home.
    Click Appointments → see Requests tab.
    Select a request → set or tweak the date/time → click Approve.
    Switch to Upcoming Sessions → verify your calendar → modify/cancel as needed.
    Use MyAccount → Clients to view client list & open history cards.
    Use MyAccount → Access Management to handle new client registrations.

*Guest→Client Workflow*

    Guest visits Home → clicks Book an Appointment → views info card → submits request.
    Therapist approves → you receive email → attend free consultation.
    If you choose to continue, register under Register tab → wait for therapist approval → log in.
    As Client, go to Book an Appointment → pick date/time & message only → submit.
    Use My Account to view past sessions and manage upcoming ones (modify/cancel).

With TherapEase, the therapist enjoys a unified console for client & appointment management, while clients get a smooth, guided experience from first contact through ongoing care— all in one modern, secure platform.
