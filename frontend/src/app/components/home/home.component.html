                    <strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</strong> is a structured, short-term therapy that helps
                    people identify and change negative patterns in their thoughts and behaviors. It's based on the idea
                    that how we think affects how we feel and act.<br />
                </p>
                <p>
                    CBT can help with a variety of issues such as <strong>anxiety, depression, stress, OCD</strong>,
                    and <strong>PTSD</strong>. Instead of focusing on the past, it works on solving current problems
                    by teaching practical skills.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recognize negative or distorted thinking</li>
                    <li>Replace it with more realistic, helpful thoughts</li>
                    <li>Develop healthier responses and coping strategies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    CBT usually lasts between <strong>5 and 20 sessions</strong> with practical exercises to apply in
                    everyday life. It’s one of the most effective and research-supported psychotherapies today.
